# JPaint
## Sprint 1 ##
* This includes functionality to create green rectangles and undo / redo said rectangles
* you may undo several rectangles and redo will bring all of them back in the reverse order
  * This is because of an honest attempt at a Singleton to create global access to two different lists: one for current shapes and one for removed shapes, not sure if this was done right as I've only seen it done at work
* I am not aware of any bugs, but the way I went about handling potential errors may be a little messy
* Project itself may be a little messy
